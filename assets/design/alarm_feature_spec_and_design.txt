## Specification and Design Document
This document contains details about features implemented or to
be implemented in the app.

1- ALARM FEATURE
  This feature will enable a user to create an alarm based
  on time from different city time zones supported by the app.

  ## SPECIFICATION

    - Visit the city time page  

    - Click on a button to set an alarm for the city selected 

    - See the alarm from the city page and the ‘Alarms’ page 

    - Go to 'Alarms’ page from the city time screen 

    - See a list of alarms set  

    - Each alarm should display corresponding local time 

    - An alarm will ring at the exact time it was set 

    - Delete alarms by swiping right 

  ## DESIGN 

    ## Classes and methods 

    - Implement the feature with existing AppState class for storing the alarm created as a key/value pair in a map object. The map object will take the “url” from the city time as a key and the alarm set as the value. 

    - Each alarm object will have the “url” and the "time” as key/value pair. 

    - Re-use existing TimeModel class for dispatching created alarm to the store as a DateTime object. A method that takes “url” and “time” as arguments will be created in the TimeModel 

    - The reducer action will update the alarm map object by adding the newly created alarm 

    - Two connectors will be created to render the alarm in the “Alarm” page and the city time page 

    - The connector in the “Alams” page will render a list of alarms from the store 

    - The connector in the city time page will render the alarm for the given “url”. This connector will take a “url” as an argument and use it to fetch the alarm time from the store
